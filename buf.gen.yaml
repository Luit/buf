  # TODO: Using a .tmpl suffix for a directory is a total hack.
  # This would need to be cleaned up so that it's much more clear
  # that a template-based plugin is being used.
  #
  # For example,
  #
  #  - name: data/template/connect-go
  #    type: template
  #    out: gen/proto/connect-go
  - name: data/template/connect-go.tmpl
    out: gen/proto/connect-go
